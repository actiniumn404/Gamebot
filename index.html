		<h2 id="hangman"><b>Hangman</b></h2>
		<h3 id="how-hangman-works">How it works</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<i>Hangman</i> is a classic game where a person, the host, gives a group
			of people a word or a phrase, where the letters are obsured by a
			placeholder, usually a dash. A player in the group will guess a letter,
			and if that letter occurs in the word/phrase, the host will write out all
			the letters matching that guessed letter in the word/phrase. If however,
			the letter does not occur in the word or phrase, then an element of a
			hanged man is drawn. If all the elements of the hanged man are drawn, then
			the game ends.
		</blockquote>
		<h3 id="hangman-on-discord">How to play it in discord</h3>
		<blockquote>
			The game beings with the host tying in the command,
			<code class="singleline"><pre>/newhangman WORD</pre></code>, with the
			placeholder "WORD" repersenting the word being used in the hangman game.
			Note that the host can also use the wildcard,
			<code class="singleline"><pre>*</pre></code>, in which when used, will
			generate a random word that even the host doesn't know. Anyways, after the
			command is entered, the message will be immidiatly deleted, to prevent
			cheaters, and a game ID, a five digit number, will be generated along with
			the pattern. (To make multiple games at the same time possible)
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			After you get the game ID and pattern, any person in the channel can guess
			a letter by typing
			<code class="singleline"><pre>/hangman ID guess LETTER</pre></code> with
			"ID" being the given game ID and "LETTER" being the guessed letter.
		</blockquote>

		<h3 id="hangman-notes">Notes:</h3>
		<blockquote>
			Note that you cannot include puncuation in your word/phrase--only English
			letters and whitespace.
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			Note that the host can end a hangman game at any time by typing the
			command
			<code class="singleline"><pre>/hangman ID end game</pre></code> with "ID"
			being the randomly generated game ID.
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			Note that the elements of the hangman are displayed via ASCII Art. For
			example, the final stage of the hangman looks like this:

			<code class="multiline">
				<pre>
+ - |
|   O
|  \|/
|  / \
|______
            </pre
				>
			</code>

		<h2 id="tic-tac-toe"><b>Tic Tac Toe</b></h2>
		<h3 id="how-ttt-works">How it works</h3>
		<blockquote>
			<i>Tic tac toe</i> is a very old game that is played on a 3x3 grid by two
			players. Those two players (<code class="singleline"><pre>X</pre></code>
			and <code class="singleline"><pre>O</pre></code>) will alternate putting
			pieces on the board. The first to have three in a row (whether it is in a
			row, column, or diagonal) wins. If the whole board is filled up, and there
			is no winner, then it is a tie.
		</blockquote>
		<h3 id="ttt-on-discord">How to play it on Discord</h3>
		<blockquote>
			To play, you will need to first create a game and send an invite to
			another server member in which you want to play with. You can do this by
			tying <code class="singleline"><pre>/newtictactoe USERNAME</pre></code>
			<b
				>with the USERNAME part being a <u>PING</u> to your opponent. It is
				really important that it is a ping.</b
			>
			Anyways, after that, a game ID will be created.
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			If you are that user who was challenged to a match of tic tac toe, you can
			accept the challenge by typing,
			<code class="singleline"><pre>/tictactoe ID accept</pre></code> with "ID"
			being the game ID. Simmilarly, you can decline by typing
			<code class="singleline"><pre>>/tictactoe ID decline</pre></code> with
			"ID" being the game ID.
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote>
			To make a move, refer to the board below, and find the coordinate that you
			want to play your move at. (e.g. C3) After that, simply type
			<code class="singleline"><pre>/tictactoe ID play COORDINATE</pre></code>
			with ID being the game id and COORDINATE being the coordinate that you
			just chose.

			<code class="multiline">
				<pre>
    1   2   3
  +-----------+
A |   |   |   |
  |-----------|
B |   |   |   |
  |-----------|
C |   |   |   |
  +-----------+ 
            </pre
